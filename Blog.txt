Today was a good day. I finished my blog website. I made strides in the main website page. Met, helped, and talked with a few old people. I went to the Holy Mass in the morning. School was alright. Should begin preparing for my SATs tommorrow. GOD HELP US. -- 2018-08-27 01:12:32.354795
Today, I had some relatives over, and it was fun. -- 2018-08-27 19:28:15.458292
This is ridiculous. Relatives don't wanna live. Is this a joke! I caan't believe what's wrong with them. When you think about it: we're havinng a great time, the only issue is that: I WANNA STUDY FOR MY SATs. I can't be asked. seriously, i need to start working. If i want that score, I have to BUST my ass. Whish me luck future generations, although by then you would have known what actually happened. -- 2018-08-27 21:23:35.836768
School was alright, like always. The kid I hate was there, we didn't talk much. I met this dude my friends used to say he's just like me, i don't know about that. i don't want to judge people from  their looks, but he was weird. Weirder than me, and that's not normal. He was very conscientious. -- 2018-08-27 21:28:36.139170
If i look like that guy. GOD HELP MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I wish get accepted into WashU, it's out of place, but I felt like saying it. -- 2018-08-27 21:31:05.497535

At this time I am about 18 hours from my toefl exam. Overall, it was hard. Really hard. The reading section was real hard. Listening was quite challenging. Speaking was alright, and writing was actually great. -- 2018-08-27 00:45:28.815558
Overall I think i did Ok; however, I do believe that my performance on test day was less than I anticipated. -- 2018-08-27 00:47:37.775323
At this time. I decided on the universities I'm going to applyto at America: WUSTL, Tufts, and Brandeis. They're all great, they do have some quirks. Brandeis is pretty bad at many things, somehow it's my safety school, it's ironic in that it is the dream school for many. Tufts doesn't care about undergrad research and don't emphasize on internships as mush as I wish. I hope i get a full ride at any of them. WUSTL is my dream school. With schools like these, you someties feel like it's not fair if you get accepted.  -- 2018-08-27 00:49:01.435929
I'm taking my SATs on 6/10, hope I cross 1520. I do, however, think it's really hard -- 2018-08-27 00:54:07.482656
Gonna start studying tommorrow, I tried to finish the main page of my portfolio today... I couldn't. GOD DAMN PADDINGS. I'm probably going to be done with my portfolio before test day. I'm hope I can at least finish one common app essay before 6/10, I don't think I'm able to though -- 2018-08-27 00:55:09.590509

Today, I went to 5dma. I went to 3 old people's houses. First one was quite normal: 2 daughter, one in kuwait and one in Canada, 1 Son, he loves his son sooooooo much, he lived in the UAE for a while then moved to Canada. His daughter lives in Ontario, don't know in which province does the other one live in. Second house was less fortunate. I single mom with a nanny. The mom didn't stay a mom for long though, he daughter passed away 2 years ago. Her only grandchild went to America and is probably never returning, he did tell her meemaw that she's coming back after a year. It's disastrous how things end up. Last house was the most miserable one. A lady with her husband and a guy that helps them around. The lady is well.... The real issue was the husband had alzheimers. He never remebered my name nor the names of the girls that were with me, granted tehy came twice before hand and it was my first time. The guy kept asking me who am I and what do I want. He moved a lot, between sitting and sleeping, I was really anxious he'd fall or something. I held his hand many times to help him with his manouvers, and he shouted beacuse my hands were cold. Helpless and hopless. I left the house full with sorrow and .... despair. One really has to value his health. Overall, I think he liked me most, not that he would remember me, but it's a nice feeling to have the blessing of this type of homosapiens.   -- 2018-08-27 00:58:32.097852

I am studying my ass off for the SAT. Today, I took 2 full practice tests, got a 1560 and a 1550, unbelievable I know! Wish i could get similar scores on the actual test. Thinking about cancelling my meeting tommorrow with the guys from elderly service. Stressed about my App essays, don;t know when to start. -- 2018-09-19 01:56:15.486954
