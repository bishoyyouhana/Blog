        This is ridiculous. Relatives don't wanna live. Is this a joke! I caan't believe what's wrong with them. When you think about it: we're havinng a great time, the only issue is that: I WANNA STUDY FOR MY SATs. I can't be asked. seriously, i need to start working. If i want that score, I have to BUST my ass. Whish me luck future generations, although by then you would have known what actually happened.

        Today, I went to 5dma. I went to 3 old people's houses. First one was quite normal: 2 daughter, one in kuwait and one in Canada, 1 Son, he loves his son sooooooo much, he lived in the UAE for a while then moved to Canada. His daughter lives in Ontario, don't know in which province does the other one live in. Second house was less fortunate. I single mom with a nanny. The mom didn't stay a mom for long though, he daughter passed away 2 years ago. Her only grandchild went to America and is probably never returning, he did tell her meemaw that she's coming back after a year. It's disastrous how things end up. Last house was the most miserable one. A lady with her husband and a guy that helps them around. The lady is well.... The real issue was the husband had alzheimers. He never remebered my name nor the names of the girls that were with me, granted tehy came twice before hand and it was my first time. The guy kept asking me who am I and what do I want. He moved a lot, between sitting and sleeping, I was really anxious he'd fall or something. I held his hand many times to help him with his manouvers, and he shouted beacuse my hands were cold. Helpless and hopless. I left the house full with sorrow and .... despair. One really has to value his health. Overall, I think he liked me most, not that he would remember me, but it's a nice feeling to have the blessing of this type of homosapiens.

        I am studying my ass off for the SAT. Today, I took 2 full practice tests, got a 1560 and a 1550, unbelievable I know! Wish i could get similar scores on the actual test. Thinking about cancelling my meeting tommorrow with the guys from elderly service. Stressed about my App essays, don;t know when to start.
